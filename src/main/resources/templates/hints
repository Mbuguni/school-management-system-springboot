    NOTE,
    MODEL
    This is the base class for any modal dialog.

    It styles the container to be a popup overlay, hidden by default, and ready to be toggled by JavaScript.
    MODAL-DIALOG
    A child container that centers the modal content and sets its width.

    MODAL-CONTENT
    Wraps the main contents of the modal (header, body, footer).

    FADE
    This class adds a fade-in and fade-out animation to the modal when it is shown or hidden.

    If you omit fade, the modal appears/disappears instantly.
    With fade, the modal smoothly transitions.
    SHOW
    Temporarily added by Bootstrap’s JS when the modal is visible (not a subclass, but important).

    Triggers the actual display and animation.
    MODAL-BACKDROP
    Automatically added by JS when modal is shown; darkens the background.

    Common Modal "Subclasses" (modifier classes for modal behavior/size):
    modal-lg — Large modal
    modal-sm — Small modal
    modal-xl — Extra large modal
    modal-dialog-centered — Vertically centers the modal
    modal-dialog-scrollable — Adds scroll to modal body if content overflows
    modal-fullscreen — Fullscreen modal
